The unique value that 7Targets assistants bring to the table is the ability to read emails, understand them and act upon most of them. 

No CRM software or email marketing softwares in the world today reads emails, and hence they cannot automatically respond to even the most basic questions. A human is needed for every small aspect of lead communication. 

7Targets assistants help in the following repetitive scenarios: 

## 1. Email Cleanup

First, no human email cleanup needed. Assistants automatically remove invalid email ids periodically. 

## 2. Unsubscribes if asked by a lead

More than 50% of leads respond saying they are not interested. and they can say that in 100 different ways. 'I am not interested', 'Please don't email me', 'Not for me' etc. The assistants read these emails, understands it, and takes the action of not sending them any more emails automatically. If you have a few thousand leads, this can be a lot of manual work, which the assistant does for you, saving tremendous effort.  

## 3. Nurtures Leads with relevant Success Stories

About 15-20% may open your emails, but are not decided whether they are interested or not. They are on the fence. 7Targets assistant marks them as WARM leads. The Assistant continues to send them periodic information that is relevant to them. eg. manufacturing leads will get manufacturing success stories and pharma leads get pharma related success stories so that leads are nurtured in the right direction. Sales often do not excel in nurturing leads with proper success stories. They may not be aligned with the marketing team’s success stories folders and may not take the trouble of finding out relevant and new success stories for each communication.  Sales try to focus on 'closing now' and not on nurturing leads to create a longer term sales pipeline.

## 4. Marks Lead as HOT and follows up with you

AI Assistant reads those 5 to 8% positive responses where leads ask for meetings. 7Targets assistant marks them as HOT leads. Assistant sends instant notifications to human sales on WhatsApp and email to ensure sales look into it immediately.  Not just that, assistant will followup with the human every 3 days automatically to ensure this HOT leads do not fall through the cracks. Even if some sales managers are not focusing on each lead in sales weekly calls, the assistant can help in ensuring all HOT leads are followed up. Without 7Targets assistants, a human sales would have to go to a CRM or a calendar or a diary and set a reminder for themselves to call the lead back. Most sales misplace such information and a good lead can fall through the cracks. 7Targets assistants do everything possible to prevent such lead drops. 

## 5. Sends Brochure within 5mins if asked

For those few leads who ask for a brochure, the assistant automatically sends them a brochure within 5 minutes as well. Response time is critical for moving faster and reducing sales cycles. A human sales may come the next day morning or Monday morning and then respond with the brochure, losing valuable time. Delayed response results in lower chances of lead opening the brochure. It's best to respond immediately till the time the lead is interested in knowing more.

## 6. Reschedules next followup if asked by lead 

Call back later: Some leads say 'Let's connect back after 2 months', 'Let’s connect in April', etc. Here as well, human sales need not spend his time on administrative responses. The Assistant reads such emails and automatically reschedules the next email connection to be sent in the specified week.
